    <h2>Design Process</h2>
    <p> When starting out I was originally thinking of doing purchases over the year and mapping out where each purchase was made. Then I was thinking about how much time I spend on my phone/laptop/etc and realized that when I am not on my phone, I am still staring at another screen for a large portion of my day</p>
    <p> I decided to plot my screentime on a chart to show what time of day I am on whcih screen and get an understanding of the time I waste where I could be doing better things for my mental health. Especially at nighttime, I can get caught up on social media and go to bed later, or the prolonged time staring at my phone can cause me to have a harder time falling asleep. These were all important things I wanted this representation to show, as well as the amount of stress that could possibly cause these habits.</p>\
    <p> One interesting thing to notice is I had an exam on Wednesday at 3:30, You can notice a pattern of more laptop screentime of the days up to the time before the exam, and not much laptop screentime after. and directly after the exam ended you can see a large jump in continuous phone scrren time to mark a relaxation period</p>
