    <p>This is the final product. The key is marked at the bottom for which color corresponds to which screen. The blank spots are areas in which I am not on any screen. As you can see the majority of the time I am looking at one screen or another and when doing other tasks I still intermittently look at a screen</p>
    <p> The Phone catagory accounts for time playing games, watching netflix, or going on social media. essentially time that I am either taking a break or wasting time</p>
    <p> The laptop catagory accounts for time spent working and cannot be adjusted in any way</p>
    <p> The last category: split, accounts for time when I am doing a task that does not require a screen for the entire duration but something that I will go on my phone during for brief periods. examples include: my office hours, working out, hanging out with friends, getting ready in the morning</p>
    <p> This highlights the amount of time spent on each screen but also highlights areas that I could spend less time playing around, and doing something beneficial such as reading a book or taking a walk</p>
